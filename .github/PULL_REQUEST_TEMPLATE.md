### Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] I've added a copyright header to every new file.
- [ ] Every new file has been correctly indented, no tabs, 4 spaces (you can use swiftlint).
- [ ] Verify that you only import what's necessary, this reduces compilation time.
- [ ] Try to declare the type of every variable and constant, not using type inference greatly reduces compilation time.
- [ ] Verify that your code compiles with the currently supported Swift version (currently 3.0.2 to support boards with Raspbian, don't use any 3.1 or 3.1.1 feature)
- [ ] You've read at least one time the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/uraimo/SwiftyGPIO/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
